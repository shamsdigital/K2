              The Sales team at Bob Rohrman Kia had no shortage of opportunities Leads were coming in from multiple channels at all times of the day and
              night, with more than 45% originating during off-hours.
             
              <br><br>With rapidly growing lead volume, the sales team was stretched to its limit. Responding to every inbound inquiry while trying to nurture customer
              relationships was becoming increasingly difficult, Too much time was being spent answering basic questions and chasing unresponsive leads,
              preventing sales reps from focusing on closing deals.
             
              <br><br>Employee frustra tion was growi ng, but what could be done wi thout adding additional headcount?

              <br>The result? Lead follow-up dwindled to ju st a few days -yet those
              are precisely the opportunities that become a key source of
              business when the market begins to cool.

            "We were already seeing early signs of a decline in leads, and with
            backlogged inventory finally coming in, we needed to make
            conservative decisions abdut costs - especially overhead and
            staffing. We're always busy, so this was stretch- ing our sales
            teams thinner than ever. We needed solutions to help us be more
            productive and eficient - without adding headcount!‚Äù
